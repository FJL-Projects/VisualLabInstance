/**
 * @brief Generates a spline along the edge of an abutment.
 *
 * This method computes the edge of the abutment's surface mesh and creates a spline
 * that outlines the margin line. It is primarily used in dental CAD/CAM applications
 * for modeling dental restorations.
 *
 * The process begins by calculating the convex hull of the projected abutment border.
 * Vertices are then equally distributed along the convex hull to prevent a zigzag pattern
 * in the resulting spline. A spline is generated through these points by adding control points
 * that are slightly inset from the actual vertex positions to ensure the spline runs along the edge.
 *
 * @note If ENABLE_TIMER_H is defined, this method will also time and report the duration
 *       of the spline generation process.
 * @note This method contains commented code for VTK-based visualization, which can be
 *       used for debugging purposes.
 *
 * Usage:
 * @code
 * CervicalMarginLineWrapper wrapper;
 * wrapper.GenerateAbutmentEdgeSpline();
 * @endcode
 *
 * @pre m_abutment_sm must be a valid surface mesh.
 * @post m_abutment_edge_spline will contain the generated spline.

 *
 * @pre m_abutment_edge_spline must be initialized with control points.

 * @pre m_renderer and m_render_win must be properly configured.
 *
 * @post The cervical margin line is visualized in the render window.
 * @post If ENABLE_TIMER_H is defined, the function's execution time is measured.
 *
 * @par Algorithm:
 *      - Calculates the orientation of the polygon formed by the spline points.
 *      - Expands the spline using MeshSplineExpander to fit the contour of the dental model.
 *      - Visualizes the expanded spline points as spheres and adds them to the renderer.
 *      - Creates a tube around the expanded spline to represent the margin line.
 *      - Sets visual properties of the tube and adds it to the renderer.
 *      - Finalizes the interaction with OnLeftButtonUp call.
 *
 * @note This function prints the size of the edge spline to the standard output.
 * @note The function is part of the CervicalMarginLineWrapper class.

/**
 * @brief Expands a selected area within a mesh based on a label and creates a new mesh from the expanded area.
 *
 * This function works by first marking faces of the input mesh that correspond to a specific label
 * from a vtkPolyData object. It then iteratively expands the selection by adding adjacent faces.
 * After expansion, a new mesh is created containing only the selected faces. A mapping between
 * the faces of the new mesh and the faces of the original mesh is also provided.
 *
 * @param mesh The input mesh from which the area will be expanded.
 * @param pd A vtkSmartPointer to a vtkPolyData object that contains cell labels.
 * @param n The label indicating the initial area to expand from.
 * @param[out] face_map An unordered_map mapping faces in the new mesh to the corresponding faces in the input mesh.
 * @param[in] expansion_level The number of iterations for the expansion process.
 * 
 * @return Returns a pointer to a new SurfaceMesh object that contains only the expanded selection of faces.
